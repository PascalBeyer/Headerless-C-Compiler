# Examples

For now this folder only contains a pile of .bat scripts that compile real world projects.
For these scripts it is usuallly necessary to have 

   1) A version on visual studio for `link.exe` and sometimes as a c++ compiler.
   2) cmake
   3) ninja

The build scipts of the various projects might also need other interpreters like python but I dunno.

In the future, this folder should also contain examples/tutorials on how to use the hlc specific features.
